            <li>Salt and ground black pepper to taste. </li>
            <li>All-purpose flour for dredging.</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons olive oil.</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon, capers, drained.</li>
            <li>1/2 cup white wine.</li>
            <li>1/4 cup fresh lemon juice.</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons coldunstaled butter.</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons fresh Italian parsley, chopped.</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Place chicken breasts between 2 layers of plastic wrap and pound to about 1/2-inch thick.</li>
            <li>Season both sides of chicken breasts with cayenne, salt, and black pepper; dredge lightly in flour and shake off any excess.</li>
            <li>Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Place chicken in the pan, reduce heat to medium, and cook until browned and cooked through, about 5 minutes per side; remove to a plate.</li>
            <li>Cook capers in reserved oil, smashing them lightly to release brine, until warmed though, about 30 seconds.</li>
            <li>Pour white wine into skillet. Scrape any browned bits from the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon. Cook until reduced by half, about 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>Stir lemon juice, water, and butter into the reduced wine mixture; cook and stir continuously to form a thick sauce, about 2 minutes. Reduce heat to low and stir parsley through the sauce.</li>
            <li>Return chicken breasts to the pan cook until heated through, 1 to 2 minutes. Serve with sauce spooned over the top.</li>
